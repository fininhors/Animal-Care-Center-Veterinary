          <h1>Why Should I Spay or Neuter My Pet?</h1>
          <p>ALL pets not intended for planned breeding programs should be surgically spayed or neutered by your veterinarian. In addition to improved health and behavior resulting from these procedures, you will be doing your part to prevent further unwanted puppies and kittens. Millions of unwanted animals are euthanized each year because there are simply not enough good homes available for all the adoptable pets.<p>

          <p>All efforts are taken to ensure that your pet is healthy before anesthesia and surgery is performed. Pre-anesthetic bloodwork can be performed to better ensure that your pet will be able to process the anesthesia normally, and there are no underlying diseases that would affect your pet's health. Spaying and neutering can cause minor discomfort for your pet. Medication is used during surgery and is available to use at home to lessen any discomfort s/he will encounter.</p>
