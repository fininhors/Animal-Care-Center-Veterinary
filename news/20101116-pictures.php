   <p>On behalf of The Franklin County Humane Society, I would like to thank the manager and staff at Tractor Supply for hosting our Halloween Pet Pictures event on Oct. 23 and 24. We are grateful to all the kind people who helped us stage this event: Linda Curty and LC Photography, Kristina Tibbo, Joanne Groat, Pat Thompson, Jim Curty, George Bowers, The Herald Chronicle, The Sewanee Mountain Messenger and Animal Care Center. And many thanks to all our friends who brought their pets in for Halloween pictures. This successful event raised over $550 for Animal Harbor.</p>
   <p>&ndash; MANDIE CURTY, President Franklin County Humane Society</p>
