   <p>Do you have a friend or family member who loves animals? Why not recognize their love by adding one of Animal Harbor’s Holiday Honor Cards to their gift? All the proceeds will go toward furthering the Humane Society's mission of rescuing and re-homing cats and dogs abandoned in Franklin County.</p>
   <p>Make a donation in your friend’s name to Animal Harbor and choose a card from three designs: Harry Pawter (dog), Pixie (kitten), Cheese and Crackers (cat and dog).</p>
   <p>Five dollars buys a card with the following on the back: &quot;A donation has been made in your honor that will feed me for a week at Animal Harbor, where I’m being cared for until I find my forever home. I hope this gift will bring you as much joy as being saved from sickness and starvation has brought me.&quot; Larger donations buy cards worded accordingly: $10 &ndash; &quot;will feed me for two weeks&quot; $20 &ndash; &quot;will feed me for a month&quot; $30 &ndash; &quot;will help to spay/neuter me or another animal&quot; These postcard-sized cards can be sent as Holiday cards, slipped inside a traditional Holiday card, used as stocking-stuffers, or given as gifts. They are available with or without envelopes, and for an additional 50&cent; we can mail them to you or directly to your friend or family member.</p>
   <p>Cards available in Sewanee from Sue Ridyard (sridyard@sewanee.edu or 598-9260), in Winchester from Animal Care Center (967-6345) or Animal Harbor (962-4472). </p>
