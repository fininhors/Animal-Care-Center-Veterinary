   <p>Winchester veterinary care facility, Animal Care Center (ACC), is currently housing more than 20 dogs that have been displaced.</p>
    <p>Amanda Curty, practice manager at ACC, said she, as well as the business owners and staff, want to make friends, clients and other local animal lovers aware that these animals do need care and, eventually, good homes.</p>
    <p>&quot;A client recently asked for our help with dogs from a questionable dog breeder who has passed away,&quot; Curty said. &quot;Dr. George and Ashley Bowers along with the staff at Animal Care Center have taken in over 20 Shih Tzus, Miniature Pinschers, Miniature Poodles, Chihuahuas, Yorkshire Terriers and Pomeranians. Right now we are trying to spay/neuter, vaccinate, deworm and get them ready for adoption.&quot;</p>
    <p>Curty asks that anyone interested in helping these dogs make a donation to the veterinary office.     </p>
    <p>&quot;These poor dogs were covered in fleas, bloated with worms, matted with dirt and fecal matter and will need socialization,&quot; she said. &quot;When they are healthy enough to leave our clinic, they will need forever homes. It's going to take a lot of effort, money and kindness to give these dogs the life that they deserve.&quot;</p>
    <p>If you are interested in adoption or know someone who is, give Animal Care Center a call at 967-6345.</p>
