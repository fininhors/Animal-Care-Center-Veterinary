   <p>Animal Care Center doctors and staff will hold a low cost spay and neuter clinic for feral cats in honor of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Month, the annual kickoff for year round educational program aimed at publicizing the need for humane animal care.</p>
   <p>Cost is $25 per cat, by reservation only, to be held Friday, April 1 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
   <p>Feral cats are the same species as companion cats, but they live outdoors in family groups and have never been socialized to people. Most animal shelters across the United States routinely kill feral cats because they can't be adopted. Over 70 percent of cats brought to animal control, pounds, or shelters are killed; the number jumps to virtually 100 percent of feral cats.</p>
   <p>With Trap-Neuter-Return, feral cats are humanely trapped and brought to a veterinarian to be tested for FELV and FIV, and healthy cats are spayed/neutered and vaccinated for rabies. Cats that have undergone the procedure are eartipped &ndash; a small portion of the left ear is painlessly removed for identification. Trap-Neuter-Return ends the cycle of breeding, makes feral cats better neighbors, and improves their lives. In the past 4 years, with the assistance of Animal Care Center and generous donations from vaccine and test manufacturers Merial and Idexx, more than 200 feral cats have been spayed/neutered and vaccinated.</p>
