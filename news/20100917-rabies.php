   <p>Animal Harbor will be promoting rabies prevention awareness and education by celebrating World Rabies Day on Sept. 28. Rabies shots will cost only $5 at the rabies vaccination clinic to be held at Animal Harbor on Sept. 28 from 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Animal Harbor is located at the corner of Highway 64 and Walnut Grove Road in Belvidere.</p>
   <p>Despite being 100 percent preventable, it is estimated that 55,000 people die worldwide from rabies each year &ndash; approximately one person every ten minutes. World Rabies Day is a global rabies awareness campaign organized by the charity Alliance for Rabies Control and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Events are planned throughout the world to increase awareness about rabies, and to raise support and funding towards its prevention and control.</p>
   <p>Animal Care Center and Animal Harbor will join the list of international partners who are working together to educate the public about the dangers of rabies to people, pets, and wildlife.</p>
   <p>Additional information is available online at www.accvets.net and at www.worldrabiesday.org or by calling Amanda Curty at the Animal Care Center (931) 967-6345.</p>
