  	<p>We are holding a low cost spay &amp; neuter clinic for feral cats. <strong>By Appointment Only.</strong></p>
		<p>With Trap‐Neuter‐Return, feral cats are tested for FELV and FIV, and healthy cats are spayed/neutered and vaccinated for rabies. Cats that have undergone the procedure are ear-tipped (a small portion of the left ear is painlessly removed for identification).</p>
		<p>To see if your cat qualifies, make an appointment, or for more info, call us today! <strong>Limited space available!</strong></p>
