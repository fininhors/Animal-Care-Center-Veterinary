  	<p>For only $30, feral cats are tested for FELV and FIV, and healthy cats are spayed/neutered and vaccinated for rabies. Cats that have undergone the procedure are ear-tipped (a small portion of the left ear is painlessly removed for identification). Space is limited for this program. Call 931.967.6345 today to reserve a spot for a feral cat in your area.</p>
