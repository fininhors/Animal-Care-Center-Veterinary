          <h2>After Hours Emergency Services</h2>
		  <p>For after-hours and weekend emergencies, please call our office at <strong>931-967-6345</strong> and follow the instructions to page our emergency service. A professional and knowledgeable technician will return your call within 15 minutes. Our emergency technician can answer questions and help you determine if your pet's situation requires immediate medical attention, and our doctors are generally available to see emergencies for our existing clients. If our doctor is not immediately available, the technician can provide you with contact information for local 24-hour emergency clinics (located in Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and Huntsville). Some veterinary clinics advertise emergency care but take more than an hour to answer emergency calls or never respond at all &ndash; we pride ourselves on responding quickly and appropriately to your emergency needs.</p>

          <h2>In-house Laboratory </h2>
		  <p>We use state-of-the-art blood analysis machines in hospital. This allows us to quickly diagnose problems while you wait, not the next day. When your pet is ill, and you want answers, we can deliver quickly. In addition, we have on-site ultrasound and digital X-ray capabilities, which further allow us to diagnose quickly and accurately. These are tools designed to save money and minimize procedures that can cause your pet unnecessary discomfort.</p>        
          <h2>Pharmacy</h2>
          <p>You now have the option of purchasing your pets flea and tick medication, as well as Hill's Science Diet prescription food, online with your credit card and have it shipped directly to you.</p>
