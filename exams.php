              We have appointments available every business day for yearly physicals, sick pets, health certificates, wellness visits, and treatment consultations.</p>
            <p>Our doctors perform pet pregnancy checks, health certificate exams, and hip certification x-rays. These services are all available by appointment. If your pet is not feeling well, or is just due for his/her yearly vaccinations and wellness exam, please call and schedule an appointment at 931-967-6345.</p>
            <p>We also offer microchiping. Microchiping your pet provides a safe and permanent form of identification. Most veterinary clinics, animal shelters, and animal control officers have a microchip scanner to help them identify lost pets. If you have questions or would like to have your pet microchiped, please give us a call.</p>
